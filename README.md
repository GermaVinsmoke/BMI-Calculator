## Overview

**BMI Calculator** is a React Hooks-based app that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their height and weight. The app stores BMI data for up to 7 days using LocalStorage, which allows users to track their BMI history over a short period.

The project was bootstrapped using _create-react-app_ and is intended to demonstrate the use of React Hooks, state management, and local storage. It can be used as a simple, lightweight health monitoring tool or as a base for more complex health-related projects.

See the [full create-react-app guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
